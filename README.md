# XT Shopping Cart Assignment

This is the base folder for the shopping cart exercise. You will have all the static assets and mock server responses available in this repo.

## Getting Started

Clone this repo and run following command for starting the mock server:

```
npm install

create a .env file in /client folder with env variables as follows
REACT_APP_API_DOMAIN_URL="DOMAIN_NAME:3000" <!-- in our case domain name is localhost -->
REACT_APP_API_CLIENT_DOMAIN_URL="DOMAIN_NAME:5000" <!-- in our case domain name is localhost -->

npm run start

If the setup isn't started yet then try installing into client manually by changing directory to /client and running npm install
# or

yarn install
yarn start
```
