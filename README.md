# XT Shopping Cart Assignment

This is the base folder for the shopping cart exercise. You will have all the static assets and mock server responses available in this repo.

## Getting Started

Clone this repo and run following command for starting the mock server:

```
npm install
npm run start -> for json-server
# or

#Used json-server inplace of canned server
#Used handlebars
#Entry point home.html : using Live server
```
