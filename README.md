Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

and then to start ui in prod

```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Deployment

I've used netlify to deploy the app, We can use [Netlify](https://netlify.com/) or [Varcel](https://vercel.com/) as well both are great and very simple to setup.

But in case of netlify you need to use `npx next export` to get the built to deploy.

Few steps to deploy on netlify [Manual, we can setup automatic deployment as well its easy to do ]

1. Create an account to netlify
2. Install `netlify CLI`
3. Login to netlify using cli
4. Prepare the build to deploy using `npx next export` >>> This will export the build to `out` dir
5. Now `run netlify deploy` it will ask few simple questions simply answer them and now just after 5 sec site is live `[as dev]`
6. To make your dev deploy to production run `netlify deploy --prod`
