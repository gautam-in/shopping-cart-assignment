Shopping Cart WebApplication is an assignment to showcase my learning and knowledge from my previous experiences in order to allocate the project.
<br>
In this web-application, I have included `React, HTML5 , CSS3, Scss` and many such libraries and tools.
<br>
I also introduce

- Plain HTML and CSS
- Authentication
- Private routing and History API
- Web Storage
- Single Page Application
- Reusable Components
- Responsive Web Pages
- Styling using `Scss`
- and such features to make an application more functional and reliable.

Note:

- please run the server as well, as I have added a new server for authentication purpose.
